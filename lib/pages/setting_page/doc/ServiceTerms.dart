After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you can do so within the ClipDrama app or log in to your application platform account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the ClipDrama application from your device. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.
